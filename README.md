Spitter

A silly program that calls you can read tweets to you. :p

Every time someone who you've followed on Spitter tweets, Spitter will call you and read their tweet to you.
Analyze user emotion based on his/her tweet. Voices switch based on the positivity of the emotion.

Based on a  very common unmet need in the social media market - people who want to check their Twitter while blindfolded.
