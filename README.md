#Spitter
----------
A silly program that calls you and reads tweets to you. :p

Every time someone who you've followed on **Spitter** (not Twitter) tweets, Spitter will call you and read their tweet to you.
**You don't need a Twitter account for following people on Spitter**
Analyze user emotion based on his/her tweet. Voices switch based on the positivity/negetivity of the emotion.

Inspiration:
Based on a *very* common unmet need in the social media market - people who want to check their Twitter while blindfolded.
